/**
 * Contains the classes required for the CSC2023 Rope Cutting Problem algorithm implementation.
 * The main runnable class is Main, and the problem solving work itself is carried out in RopeCuttingProblem,
 * the other classes are all either data structures that I created to hold rope/order information in, or JUnit unit
 * test classes to test the solution implementation and the data structures (along with providing runtime analysis for
 * the solution).
